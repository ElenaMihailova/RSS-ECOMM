## Running the Project

To run the project in development mode, use the `npm run dev` command. This will start the webpack-dev-server, which automatically reloads the page when files are changed.

To build the project for production, use the `npm run build` command.

## Testing

We use Jest for testing our project. You can run all tests using the `npm run test` command.

## Code Formatting and Linting

To ensure code consistency we use ESLint and Prettier. You can check your code for issues using the `npm run lint` command, and automatically fix many of them using the `npm run lint:fix` command.

To automatically format your code, use the `npm run prettier` command.
